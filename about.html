        I'm a rising MEng student. I graduated from MIT in 2023 with two degrees: Math and Computer Science Engineering.
        
        I've TA-d for 6.1220 (Algorithms) in the past,
        and I'd say that kind of theoretical puzzle solving is what I like the most, but I like all sorts of things, and am interested in building things in the future.

        I'm also heavily involved with music, and recently have been interested in learning languages.
